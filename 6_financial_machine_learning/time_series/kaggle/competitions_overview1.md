### Kaggle Time Series Competitions and Solutions (1)

*Jul 14, 2020*


1. M5 Forecasting - Accuracy: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy
1. Home Credit Default Risk: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

<h4> Notes:</h4>

- learning API: 
    - LightGBM is becoming more popular than XGBoost. LightGBM is much faster than XGBoost and can achieve better performance in same amount of time in general.
    - Neural networks work but do not always perform better than tree-based models. (*in my experience, with limited time and computing resources, LightGBM always outperform neural networks)
    
- objective function/loss function
    - custom objective/loss function sometime helps
    
- k-fold and validation set
    - for time series data, it is extremely difficult to create a sound/robust validation set

<h3>Time series resources and methodologies </h3>


1. Recursive, direct, and hybrid modeling: https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy/discussion/151927
>  - 4 Strategies for Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-step-time-series-forecasting/
>      - Recursive and direct multi-step forecasting: the best of both worlds: https://robjhyndman.com/papers/rectify.pdf
>      - Recursive models have the problem of bias, but they are nice because the model has the same underlying structure for every prediction. 
Direct models are different from day to day, and can be very different, leading to high variance in the predictions.
>      - So it seems to me that we should use recursive modeling to get some precise predictions, although they are biased, and then use direct modeling to reduce the bias in our predictions.

1. Time Series Cross-Validation: evolution, xgboost, features: https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting/discussion/46602
>  -  A Note on the Validity of Cross-Validation for Evaluating Autoregressive Time Series Prediction: https://robjhyndman.com/papers/cv-wp.pdf
 the use of standard K-fold CV is possible as long as the models considered have uncorrelated errors
    When purely (non-linear, nonparametric) autoregressive methods are applied to forecasting problems, as is often the case
(e.g., when using Machine Learning methods), the aforementioned problems of CV are largely irrelevant, and CV can and should be used without modification, as in the independent case.

     - Our single models are all lgb models
     - key for our team is that everyone brings a good model that is different from others, key for our team is that everyone brings a good model that is different from others
     - The final results show that golden rule still holds: trust your local CV. 
     - We are using stratified 10-fold as the cross validation method. 


1. A few notes: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/58332

   Try different K-fold sets to see if your model is stable, ..., so TRUST YOUR LOCAL CV!!!
   LGB and XGB have a rich toolset to remove noisy features and regularize your models. Two of the most important for this competition are *feature fraction* and *reglambda*.

   **tuning**:

     If you're using xgboost, switch to LightGBM, which is much faster. (That's not to say that you shouldn't eventually use XGB to build a model, but it makes more sense to start with LGB and then move on to XGB when you can no longer improve your LGB model.)

    Start with a relatively high learning rate (e.g., 0.2 or 0.1) and tune the other parameters with this high rate. Then lower the learning rate and fine-tune the parameters.

   Tune manually instead of using an automatic optimization method. I know this is old-school, but I find tuning manually gives me insights into the data that I would miss with an automatic method.

   If you are keeping the learning rate constant, you don't need to wait for early stopping to end a validation round. It's often clear much sooner that whatever tuning change you just made is making the model worse, so you can abort that validation run.

   In concert with point #4, pay attention to the training error as well as the validation error. What you want when tuning parameters is a lower validation error given a fixed training error.
