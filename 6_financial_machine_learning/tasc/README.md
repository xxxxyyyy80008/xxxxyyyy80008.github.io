Cagigas compares Megan to the Sharpe ratio and K-ratio, and suggests that Megan be utilized as a means of comparing trading systems. He presents three strategies to demonstrate Megan’s ability to improve the trader’s ability to critique different strategy options.\n\nWe have implemented Megan in such a way that it can be used in charting, RadarScreen, and in the new Scanner (available in TradeStation 8.4). Cagigas’s three strategies are presented here. The code for running his first strategy in RadarScreen and in the Scanner will be posted in the Trade\xadStation and EasyLanguage support forum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Oscar Cagigas                            |\n|   2009 |       2 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2009/02/TradersTips.html | Markos Katsanos\' article in this issue, "Trading The Aussie," provides system rules for using intermarket signals to trade the Australian dollar/US dollar currency pair. Signals are generated using six different datasets, including the Australian dollar, Crb Index, Phlx Gold and Silver Sector Index, the 90-day Aussie bank bill futures, and 10-year Aussie Treasury.\n\nSo that we can replicate his results, the author has provided data for the Aussie Bank Bill and Treasury symbols. The two Aussie datasets will be available with the code.

Strategy code in EasyLanguage is presented here.\n\nTradeStation relies on external add-ons to perform Monte Carlo simulations of strategies. There are active discussions in our support forums on the merits of various Monte Carlo add-ons. These discussions mention the following products (not a recommendation of any particular add-on): ProSizer, @Risk, Portfolio, MC Sim, Risk Analyzer, TreeAge Pro, Market System Analyzer, and Rina. Costs for these products range from free to several thousand dollars.\n\nSpecial K\n\nMartin Pring’s article “The Special K” (Stocks & Commodities, December 2008) describes a timing indicator that seeks to identify the direction of the primary trend, along with short-term buy and sell signals and trade reversal signals. (See Figure 1.)\n\nSpecial K is based on the Kst (Know Sure Thing) indicator that Pring developed in the 1990s. Special K is defined in terms of daily and weekly bars.

From this, Katsanos extracts the basic trading rule: short in June or July, buy any other month except August. This insight is then combined with two different trading strategies: a simple seasonal breakout that buys in September and shorts in June, and one that combines seasonal bias with moving average crossover signals coming from daily dollar index and soybean price activity. Finally, a simple moving average crossover system based entirely on daily soy price action is provided for comparison purposes.\n\nFor this second system, Katsanos provides his daily, inflation-adjusted cycle data in the form of a text file. This can be imported directly (with provided soy and dollar data) to reproduce the published results.

If the strategy determines that the market is in trending mode, then the strategy is allowed to trade with the trend — either long, in uptrends, or short, in downtrends.

Hawkins’ modified volume-price trend indicator uses a reduced volume term (rV) rather than volume. The rV value is equal to volume times the percentage change in the value ((Open + High + Low + Close) / 4). (Granville used bar closing prices.) Hawkins also suggests plotting prices on a logarithmic scale while plotting the indicator on a linear scale. If necessary, the alignment of chart and indicator can be adjusted using the inputs level and scale. The input level is added to a value that is equal to the input scale multiplied by the calculated Vpt value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | David Hawkins                            |\n|   2010 |       5 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2010/05/TradersTips.html | Sylvain Vervoort’s article in this issue, “Smoothing The Bollinger %b,” reviews John Bollinger’s band calculations and then suggests some modifications of them.

His strategy involves establishing trend by comparing the normalized volatility indicator (Nvi) to a constant threshold value. If the Nvi is above the threshold value, the strategy closes any long positions and sells short every day until the Nvi crosses below the threshold value. If the Nvi is below the threshold, the strategy closes any short positions and buys every day until the Nvi crosses above the threshold value.\n\nTwo indicators and two strategies were coded for this project. The Kayakkal_NVI plots the Nvi value and two moving averages of the Nvi value. The Kayakkal_Position indicator plots the number of shares/contracts in the current position. The Kayakkal_NVIStrategy tests the basic system. The Kayakkal_NVIStratAvg is similar to the basic system, with a filter to enter long positions only if price is above a 200-day exponential moving average (Ema) of the close, and to enter short positions only if price is below a 200-day Ema of the close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Rajesh Kayakkal                          |\n|   2010 |       9 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2010/09/TradersTips.html | In his article in this issue, “Getting Clear With Short-Term Swings,” author Ron Black provides a straightforward indicator based on price clearing the lowest high after a downtrend, or price clearing a highest low after an uptrend.

The resulting curve is then transformed with an inverse Fisher filter.\n\nFisher suggests that a breakout above 12 indicates buying opportunities and a breakdown below 88 indicates selling opportunities.

Entry and exit conditions for the strategy can be found in the code comments in the strategy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Peter Konner                             |\n|   2011 |       2 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2011/02/TradersTips.html | In “The Spearman Indicator For Technical Analysis” in this issue, author Dan Valcu describes the use of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to aid in identifying trend intensity and turning points.

The concept is to identify bars that are a Fibonacci or Lucas number of bars from a key bar on the chart, then use this and other information to determine potential market reaction.\n\nHere, we present indicator code that will identify bars that are a Fibonacci or Lucas number of bars from a given “start bar.” Once the start bar is found by the code, a counter starts. If the counter matches one of the Fibonacci or Lucas numbers discussed in the article, the bar is identified with a PaintBar or ShowMe marker as set by the inputs. Multiple insertions of the indicator with different colors, plot styles (PaintBar or ShowMe), and offsets can be used to identify confluence of different insertions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Andrew Coles                             |\n|   2011 |       9 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2011/09/TradersTips.html | For this month’s Traders’ Tip, we’ve provided eSignal formulas based on Andrew Coles’ article in this issue.\n\nThe Ermanometry study (Figure 2) contains formula parameters to set the start date, start time, first wave period, and second wave period with options to show the Erman segments and Coles segments, which may be configured through the Edit Chart window.

These indicators include Keltner channels, the commodity channel index (CCI), the average directional movement index (ADX), and a volume oscillator.\n\nEasyLanguage code for a combined indicator (all but CCI) is presented here. The indicator code plots the Keltner channel and colors the bars based on the ADX and the relationship of the bar’s closing price to an eight-bar simple moving average. It also plots a dot marker based on volume surges. Details of the conditions required for painting the bars and plotting the dot markers can be found in Star’s article.\n\nThe CCI can be plotted using the TradeStation built-in indicator called Comm Channel Index. Also shown here is some strategy code for a breakout strategy that enters long when CCI is greater than zero and the close is greater than the upper Keltner band; it enters short when CCI is less than zero and the close is less than the lower Keltner band. A long position is exited when price closes below the upper Keltner band or CCI goes below zero.

The VIX is compared to its 50-day simple moving average, and the number of consecutive days above or below the moving average is tracked. When the number of consecutive days reaches 11, a buy or sell is generated based on whether the VIX is above or below its moving average.\n\nIn his article, Gardner describes trading the exchange traded funds (ETFs) SPY and DDM and the rules for entry and exit.

The calculations are illustrated in an Excel workbook created by the author.\n\nProvided here is a function that calculates the CumAD, an indicator that plots the CumAD and a moving average of the CumAD, plus a strategy. The strategy enters long when the CumAD crosses over its moving average and sells (exits the long, but does not enter short) when CumAD crosses under its moving average. Note that the function code utilizes multiple datastreams to calculate the CumAD values on each bar. Datastreams for advancing issues and declining issues must be added to the chart. The function is flexible and allows for specifying which datastream number (for example, 2 for Data2, 3 for Data3, and so on) contains the data for advancing issues and which datastream number contains the data for declining issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Ron McEwan                               |\n|   2013 |       5 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2013/05/TradersTips.html | In “Head & Shoulders, Algorithmically (Part 2)” in this issue, author Giorgos Siligardos describes a mechanical method for detecting the classic head & shoulders chart pattern.

We are providing two functions, two indicators, and a strategy. One function (_PMACDLevel2) returns the next bar price required to achieve a particular MACD value (for example, zero, current bar MACD value, and so on). The other function (_PMACDsignal) returns the next bar price required for the MACD histogram to be zero. One indicator (_PMACD_Ind3) plots the PMACDeq, PMACDzero, and PMACDsignal values referred to in the article. These plots can be shown or not shown based on the indicator inputs.\n\nThe second indicator (sMACD) is an MACD indicator that uses simple moving averages instead of exponential moving averages.

Vervoort starts with simple line charts, which are nothing more than a line connecting points that represent some aspect of the market that changes. Each point is a line segment endpoint, and the offset between points is the chart interval. Vervoort states he doesn’t find these useful, as too much data is ignored. Next, he reviews open, high, low, close (OHLC) representations: bar, tick bar, and candlestick charts. Both are able to display the OHLC data, with differing visual emphasis for the trader. The author states he feels these bar types present the trader with too much noise.\n\nThe author then reviews two bar types that might offer an answer to the noise issue: range bars and renko bars. He raises three issues with regard to autotrading and backtesting. First, he expresses that he doesn’t like the lack of wicks. Next, he points out that the actual open and close may not be the same as those displayed on the chart. Finally, he states that gaps could be filled with untradable virtual bars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Sylvain Vervoort                         |\n|   2014 |       8 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2014/08/TradersTips.html | In “The Quotient Transform” in this issue, author John Ehlers describes an early trend detection method that is designed to reduce the lag often found in other trend indicators.

While the percentage price oscillator discussed in this issue and the MACD technique from his article December 2017 issue (“Weekly & Daily MACD”) are somewhat similar, Apirine notes that the percentage price oscillator has advantages when used with longer-term charts. In addition, the author shows that due to its construction, the percentage price oscillator is well-suited to comparing different securities, whereas the used of the MACD as described in his previous article is better suited to identifying overbought and oversold levels of a single security.                                                                                                    | Vitali Apirine                           |\n|   2018 |       3 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2018/03/TradersTips.html | In “Recursive Median Filters” in this issue, author John Ehlers presents an approach for filtering out extreme price and volume data that can throw off typical averaging calculations. Ehlers goes on to present a novel oscillator using this technique, comparing its response to the well-known RSI.

His update to the original KAMA allows the new method to account for the location of the close relative to the high–low range. The author describes a trading system that combines the AMA and KAMA, suggesting that the combination may reduce the number of whipsaws relative to using either moving average by itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Vitali Apirine                           |\n|   2018 |       5 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2018/05/TradersTips.html | In “RocketRSI—A Solid Propellant For Your Rocket Science Trading” in this issue, author John Ehlers introduces a new take on the classic RSI indicator originally developed by J.

The MAD indicator effectively took the difference between two simple moving averages. While the MAD is said to offer an improvement over the classic, well-known MACD, the MADH (moving average difference with Hann) that Ehlers presents in his article in this issue, “The MADH: The MAD Indicator, Enhanced,” is said to offer an improvement over the MAD indicator. The enhancement comes from the utilization of the Hann windowing technique and takes the difference of two finite impulse response filters.

In this issue\'s article, Apirine describes the relative strength volatility-adjusted exponential moving average (RS VolatAdj EMA).\n\nThe indicator is designed to account for relative strength of volatility, and it requires a second, corresponding volatility index. For example, if charting the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), one can use the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX.X). The indicator compared to itself of varying lengths, or the indicator compared to a traditional EMA with the same length, can be used to help to identify trends and turning points. During an uptrend, RS VolatAdj EMA crossovers can be used to help identify entry points for long trades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Vitali Apirine                           |\n|   2022 |       4 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/04/TradersTips.html | Historical data has generally supported the long-standing financial adage “Sell in May and go away, buy in October and stay sober.” Markos Katsanos decided to investigate this apothegm with more recent data, different time periods, and taking into account drawdown and risk-adjusted returns. In his article in this issue, he presents his in-depth findings and possible rational behind them. He then presents his hybrid seasonal system designed to improve on the seasonal systems by adding other technical indicators.\n\nMarkos Katsanos’ volume flow indicator (VFI) calculation uses a default period of 130 days for daily charts. As a result, when applying the strategy, you will need to set the maximum number of bars the study will reference in the general tab of properties for all to at least 130. In order to compare the system objectively with the buy & hold results, he specified a trade size as a percent of equity. The supplied strategy code does not have specified trade sizes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Markos Katsanos                          |\n|   2022 |       5 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/05/TradersTips.html | In part 1 of a three-part series focused on differences between traditional EMAs and relative strength-based EMA indicators, author Vitali Apirine introduces the relative strength exponential moving average (RS EMA). The study is designed to account for relative strength of price and is considered a trend-following indicator that can be used in combination with an EMA of the same length to identify the overall trend. RS EMAs with different lengths can define turning points and filter price movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Vitali Apirine                           |\n|   2022 |       6 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/06/TradersTips.html | In his article in this issue, “Ehlers Loops,” John Ehlers presents some concepts of price and volume relationship to determine if any predictive value can be obtained by the analysis. In the analysis, both price and volume are filtered using high-pass and low-pass filters with the result delivering the desired data wavelengths. The author suggests that the resulting Ehlers Loops are a way to discretionarily predict bullish and bearish moves that are based on the curvature and direction of rotation of motion in the price-volume chart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | John Ehlers                              |\n|   2022 |       7 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/07/TradersTips.html | In part 1 of his article in the June 2022 issue (“Ehlers Loops”), John Ehlers uses a relationship of price and volume to determine if any predictive value can be obtained. His technique, called Ehlers Loops, aid in visualizing the performance of one datastream against another. In part 2 appearing in this issue (“Pairs Rotation With Ehlers Loops”), the author demonstrates Ehlers Loops in action with a pairs trading example. This pairs rotation strategy is aimed at minimizing drawdown while simultaneously maximizing return on capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | John Ehlers                              |\n|   2022 |       8 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/08/TradersTips.html | In his article in this issue, “Trading The Fear Index,” author Markos Katsanos explains how the VIX (Cboe Volatility Index), often called the “fear index,” is used by traders as a measure of the 30-day expected volatility of the US stock market. While many traders use the index as a gauge of potential market movements, many ignore potential trading opportunities that the index offers. The VIX itself cannot be traded directly; however, there are instruments that offer exposure to the index, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Markos Katsanos presents a set of rules for a long-short volatility trading system that attempts to capture a sizable part of the volatility spikes while also benefiting from the long-term time decay of the volatility ETFs. Two strategies are exhibited: one for long VIX ETFs and one for inverse (short) VIX ETFs.                      | Markos Katsanos                          |\n|   2022 |       9 | https://traders.com/Documentation/FEEDbk_docs/2022/09/TradersTips.html | In his article in the August 2022 issue, “The Linear Regression-Adjusted Exponential Moving Average,” author Vitali Apirine presents a technique called the linear regression-adjusted exponential moving average (LRAdj EMA) to combine a linear regression indicator with an exponential moving average. The indicator can be used to help define turning points while filtering price movement. The LRAdj EMA can be used in combination with a traditional exponential moving average of the same length to facilitate trend identification.
