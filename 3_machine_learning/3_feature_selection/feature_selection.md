    > - it is a **wrapper-based feature selection method** based on the concept of **Markov Blanket (MB)**. 
    > - it can work for both classification and regression tasks on datasets containing categorical and/or continuous features. 
    > - *according to the authors*, the PPFS outperforms state-of-the-art Markov blanket discovery algorithms and well-known wrapper methods.
