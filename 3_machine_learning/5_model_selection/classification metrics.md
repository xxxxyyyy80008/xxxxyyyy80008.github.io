##### highlights of paper


> "GM (Geometric Mean) and BM (Bookmaker Informedness) are the best performance metrics if their focus on successes (dismissing the errors) presents no limitation for the specific application where they are used. However, if classification errors must also be considered, then MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient) arises as the best choice."
