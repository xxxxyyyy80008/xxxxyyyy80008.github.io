###### 2. Run command to create a virtual environment

- run command:  `py -3.7 -m venv env37`
>- *py -3.7* indicates creating a virtual enviroment in python verions 3.7. if you are working in python 3.9, then the command is  `py -3.9 -m venv env37`
>- env37 is the name of the new virtual environment. You can change it to whatever name of your choice, for example, it could be envaaa, and in this case the command is: `py -3.7 -m venv envaaa`
>- after this command is run successfully, a new folder is created in your destination folder. The name of the new folder is the same as the environment name.
